# 1. Overview of RDBMS and SQL

## Database Management System (DBMS)
- A database is a collection of related data organized in a way that data can
be easily accessed ,managed and updated
- To overcome the limitations of the traditional file processing system,DBMS
was created
- A general-purpose Database Management System(DBMS) is a software
system intended to organize, store and retrieve large amounts of data
- Some examples for database management systems are
  > MySql, Oracle, Microsoft SQL server, MS Foxpro, SQLite and FileMaker Pro
- The primary goal of a Database Management System(DBMS) is to provide
a convenient and efficient way to store and retrieve database information
- Relational DBMS (RDBMS) is the most successfully used Data Base
Management System
## Relational Database Management System
- In relational model, data is stored in database object called **table**
- The table is a collection of related data entities and it consists of rows and
columns
- A **tuple**, also called a **row** of data, is each individual entry or record that
exists in a table
- Every table is broken up into smaller entities called **fields**. A field is a
**column** in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about
every record in the table
- A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information
associated with a specific field in a table

## Structured Query Language
Structured Query Language or SQL is a standard querying language for
organizing, managing, and retrieving data stored in relational database. SQL is
pronounced as 'sequel' which was previously known as 'Structured English Query
Language'

> #### SQL is mainly used to perform the below tasks
- Querying data
- Inserting, updating, and deleting rows in a table
- Creating, replacing, altering, and dropping objects
- Controlling access to the database and its objects
- Guaranteeing database consistency and integrity

> #### SQL Statements can be broadly classified into below categories:
- Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Transaction Control Language (TCL)
- Data Control Language (DCL)
- Data Query Language (DQL) or Data Retrieval Language (DRL) (SELECT statements which in most cases are also referred to as DML statement)
