#### Creating Objects along with data

```sql
DROP TABLE departments;
CREATE TABLE departments
    ( department_id    NUMBER(4) 
    , department_name  VARCHAR2(30)
    , CONSTRAINT dept_id_uk  		 UNIQUE(department_id)
    ) ;

DROP TABLE departments_rejected;
CREATE TABLE departments_rejected
    ( department_id    NUMBER(4) 
    , department_name  VARCHAR2(30)
    ) ;
    
select * from departments;

select * from departments_rejected;


create table deprtment_source as 
select 10 as id,'IT' as name from dual
union all
select 20 as id,'SALES' as name from dual
union all
select 10 as id,'SOFTWARE' as name from dual
;

```

<br> 

#### Insert using SQL

```sql
insert into departments
select * from deprtment_source
```
> ORA-00001: unique constraint (SYSTEM.DEPT_ID_UK) violated

<br>  

#### Procedure Creation

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE DATA_INSERT 
IS 
CURSOR c1 IS SELECT * FROM deprtment_source;
var1 deprtment_source % rowtype;

BEGIN
	OPEN c1;

LOOP

	BEGIN
	
		FETCH c1 INTO var1;

		EXIT when c1 % notfound;

		INSERT INTO departments
		VALUES (var1.id, var1.name);

		COMMIT;

		EXCEPTION 
		when others then
		INSERT INTO departments_rejected
		VALUES (var1.id, var1.name);
	END;
	
END LOOP;

CLOSE c1;

-- exception when others then

-- INSERT INTO departments_rejected
-- VALUES (var1.id, var1.name);

END;
```

#### Procedure Execution  
```sql
--TRUNCATE TABLE departments;
--TRUNCATE TABLE departments_rejected;

--SELECT * FROM deprtment_source;
--SELECT * FROM departments;
--SELECT * FROM departments_rejected;

EXECUTE DATA_INSERT;

--SELECT * FROM departments;
--SELECT * FROM departments_rejected;

```

<br>  

##### Clearing schema  

```sql
DROP TABLE departments;
DROP TABLE departments_rejected;
DROP TABLE deprtment_source;
```
