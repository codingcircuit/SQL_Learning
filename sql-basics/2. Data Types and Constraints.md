# 2. Data Types and Constraints

### Character Data Types
Oracle Database has **three key character types**:

- varchar2
- char
- clob
```
You use these to store general purpose text.
```

<br> <br />
> #### Varchar2
This stores variable length text. You need to specify an upper limit for the size of these strings. In Oracle Database 11.2 and before, the maximum you can specify is 4,000 bytes. From 12.1 you can increase this length to 32,767.

<br> <br />
> #### Char
These store fixed-length strings. If the text you insert is shorter than the max length for the column, the database right pads it with spaces.
The maximum size of char is 2,000 bytes.

> [!NOTE]
> Only use char if you need fixed-width data. In the vast majority of cases, you should use varchar2 for short strings.

<br> <br />
> #### Clob
If you need to store text larger than the upper limit of a varchar2, use a clob. This is a character large object. It can store data up to (4 gigabytes - 1) * (database block size). In a default Oracle Database installation this is 32Tb!

<br> <br />
##### The following statement creates a table with various character columns:
```sql
create table character_data (
  varchar_10_col   varchar2(10),
  varchar_4000_col varchar2(4000),
  char_10_col      char(10),
  clob_col         clob
);

select column_name, data_type, data_length
from   user_tab_columns
where  table_name = 'CHARACTER_DATA';
```
> [!NOTE]
> Each of these types also has an N variation; nchar, nvarchar2, and nclob. These store Unicode-only data. It's rare you'll use these data types.
