# 6. Data Retrieval Language (SELECT)

- The SELECT statement is used to retrieve the data from one or more tables
- Using SELECT statement the following operation can be performed
  
     - Projection : The operation displays subset of columns
     - Selection  : The operation displays subset of rows

<br>  

##### A Typical SELECT statement may consists of six clauses.
```sql
SELECT column_name [, column_list] [,aggregated_column]
FROM table_name
[WHERE search_condition]
[GROUP BY grouping_columns_names]
[HAVING aggregated_search_condition]
[ORDER BY sorting_columns]
```

> [!NOTE]
> The SELECT and FROM clauses of the statement are mandatory. The remaining four clauses are optional

<br>  
 

## Transaction Start and End Scenarios

- A Transaction begins when the first executable SQL statement is encountered.
- The Transaction terminates when any of the following actions occur.
     - A COMMIT or ROLL BACK issued.
     - A DDL statement issued
     - A DCL statement issued
     - Normal shut down from database
     - Failure of machine or system crashes

## Explicit Transaction Control Statements
- COMMIT
- SAVEPOINT
- ROLLBACK

<br>  


#### COMMIT

- It ends the current Transaction by making all pending data changes permanent.
- Once committed, all users can view the recent changes.

<br>  


```sql
COMMIT;

```
<br>  


```sql
rem DROP table
DROP TABLE department;

rem CREATE department table
CREATE TABLE department
    ( department_id    NUMBER(4) 
    , department_name  VARCHAR2(30)  CONSTRAINT  dept_name_nn1  NOT NULL
    , manager_id       NUMBER(6)
    , location_id      NUMBER(4)
    , CONSTRAINT dept_id_pk1  		 PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
    ) ;



rem first row INSERT
INSERT INTO department    VALUES (20, 'Marketing', 201, 1800);

rem second row INSERT
INSERT INTO department    VALUES (30, 'Purchasing', 114, 1700);
              
rem Once changes are committed to database, they are permanent.   
rem It is not possible to revert them using ROLLBACK or ROLLBACK along with SAVEPOINT
COMMIT;
```

<br>  

```sql
select * from department ;
```

<br>  
<br> 

#### SAVEPOINT

- SAVEPOINT is used to mark a point in the current transaction to which we
can later roll back.
- We can create multiple savepoints in a single transaction.
- Savepoints can be used to control the reve rting of changes.

<br>  


```sql
SAVEPOINT <NAME>;
``` 


<br>  

```sql
rem DROP table
DROP TABLE department;

rem CREATE department table
CREATE TABLE department
    ( department_id    NUMBER(4) 
    , department_name  VARCHAR2(30)  CONSTRAINT  dept_name_nn1  NOT NULL
    , manager_id       NUMBER(6)
    , location_id      NUMBER(4)
    , CONSTRAINT dept_id_pk1  		 PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
    ) ;



rem first row INSERT
INSERT INTO department  
              VALUES     ( 20, 'Marketing', 201, 1800);

SAVEPOINT firstrow;

rem second row INSERT
INSERT INTO department 
              VALUES (30, 'Purchasing', 114, 1700);
              
rem this will take the database back to the point when SAVEPOINT is created, i.e when first row is inserted
ROLLBACK to firstrow;

rem This will commit the first row alone to the table
COMMIT;

```

<br>  
<br> 



```sql          
select * from department ;
```

<br>  

#### ROLLBACK

- Ends the current transaction by discarding all pending data changes.
- The data changes are undone.
- Restores the state of the database to the last commit point.
- The locks on the affected rows are automatically released.

```sql
rem 1. ROLLBACK general
ROLLBACK;    

rem 2. ROLLBACK to SavePoint  
ROLLBACK to <SAVEPOINT NAME>;
```

<br>  
<br>  

```sql
rem DROP table
DROP TABLE department;

rem CREATE department table
CREATE TABLE department
    ( department_id    NUMBER(4) 
    , department_name  VARCHAR2(30)  CONSTRAINT  dept_name_nn1  NOT NULL
    , manager_id       NUMBER(6)
    , location_id      NUMBER(4)
    , CONSTRAINT dept_id_pk1  		 PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
    ) ;



rem first row INSERT
INSERT INTO department  
              VALUES     ( 20, 'Marketing', 201, 1800);


rem second row INSERT
INSERT INTO department 
              VALUES (30, 'Purchasing', 114, 1700);
              
rem Once changes are rolled back, they are permanent.   
rem We will not be able to revert them using COMMIT or ROLLBACK along with SAVEPOINT
ROLLBACK;
```

<br>  
<br> 



```sql          
select * from department ;
```

> [!NOTE]
> No records are  inserted into the table due to ROLBACK command.
