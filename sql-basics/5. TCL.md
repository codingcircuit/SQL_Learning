# 5. Transaction Control Language (TCL)

- Oracle server considers transactions for ensuring data consistency.
- A transaction is a set of one or more DML statements which Oracle treats as a single logical unit of work.
- A transaction groups SQL statements so that they are either all committed (applied to the database) or rolled back (undone from the database).
- All changes made by DML statements are made permanent and visible to other users only after committing the changes.
- DCL and DDL commands always force a commit and explicit committing is not required.

<br>  



## Transaction Start and End Scenarios

- A Transaction begins when the first executable SQL statement is encountered.
- The Transaction terminates when any of the following actions occur.
     - A COMMIT or ROLL BACK issued.
     - A DDL statement issued
     - A DCL statement issued
     - Normal shut down from database
     - Failure of machine or system crashes

## Explicit Transaction Control Statements
- COMMIT
- SAVEPOINT
- ROLLBACK

#### INSERT

Below is the script to create Employees and Departments tables (**HR Schema**) along with constraints (**inline specification**)

```sql

rem DROP tables
DROP TABLE department;
DROP TABLE department_copy;

rem CREATE department table
CREATE TABLE department
    ( department_id    NUMBER(4) 
    , department_name  VARCHAR2(30)  CONSTRAINT  dept_name_nn1  NOT NULL
    , manager_id       NUMBER(6)
    , location_id      NUMBER(4)
    , CONSTRAINT dept_id_pk1  		 PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
    ) ;

rem CREATE department_copy table
CREATE TABLE department_copy
    ( department_id    NUMBER(4) 
    , department_name  VARCHAR2(30)  CONSTRAINT  dept_name_nn2  NOT NULL
    , manager_id       NUMBER(6)
    , location_id      NUMBER(4)
    , CONSTRAINT dept_id_pk2  		 PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
    ) ;


rem 1)
rem INSERT using column list
INSERT INTO department (DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NAME, MANAGER_ID, LOCATION_ID)  
              VALUES     ( 10, 'Administration', 200, 1700);

rem 2)            
rem INSERT without column list - the data should be inserted in the order of columns for all the columns
INSERT INTO department 
              VALUES ( 20, 'Marketing', 201, 1800);

rem 3)
rem INSERT records in an interactive manner
INSERT INTO department VALUES (&DEPARTMENT_ID, '&DEPARTMENT_NAME', &MANAGER_ID, &LOCATION_ID);

rem 4)             
rem INSERT data or copy data from one table to another
INSERT INTO department_copy 
              SELECT * FROM department;

```


<br>

> [!NOTE]
> When SQL for INSERT records in an interactive manner is executed, you will be prompted to enter the values for arguments.  
> Below are the provided values here
>   
> Enter value for DEPARTMENT_ID : 30  
> Enter value for DEPARTMENT_NAME : Purchasing  
> Enter value for MANAGER_ID : 114  
> Enter value for LOCATION_ID : 1700

 ```sql
rem old:
INSERT INTO department VALUES (&DEPARTMENT_ID, '&DEPARTMENT_NAME', &MANAGER_ID, &LOCATION_ID)
``` 
```sql
rem new:
INSERT INTO department VALUES (30, 'Purchasing', 114, 1700)
```

<br>  

<br>  


```sql
select * from department ;
```

#### UPDATE

- Update command is used to change or modify one or more record data in a table.
- When a WHERE condition is specified
    -  first, the records which satisfy the condition are filtered.
    -  then, updation is done only on those records which satisfy the condition.
- All rows will be updated if no condition is specified in where clause.

<br>  


```sql
rem UPDATE using WHERE clause
UPDATE department
SET DEPARTMENT_NAME = 'Single Row Update'
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 10 ;

rem UPDATE without WHERE clause
UPDATE department_copy
SET DEPARTMENT_NAME = 'All Rows Update' ;
``` 


<br>  


```sql
select * from department ;
```

<br>  



```sql          
select * from department_copy ;
```

<br>  


#### DELETE

- Delete statement is used to remove records from a table.
- A subset may be defined for deletion using WHERE condition; otherwise all records will be removed.

```sql
rem DELETE with WHERE condition
DELETE FROM department
WHERE DEPARTMENT_NAME = 'Single Row Update' ;

rem DELETE without WHERE condition
DELETE FROM department_copy ;
```

<br>  
<br>  

```sql
select * from department ;
```

<br>  
<br> 



```sql          
select * from department_copy ;
```

> [!NOTE]
> Without WHERE condition all the records will be deleted in the table.
