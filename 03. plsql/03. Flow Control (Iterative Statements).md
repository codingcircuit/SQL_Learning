# 03. Flow Control (Iterative Statements)

- Iterative statements provide the ability to repeatedly execute a block of code until some condition is met.
- PL/SQL uses loops to accomplish iterative execution.

<br>  

 
- Three types of iterative statements are
  
    - Simple Loop
    - FOR Loop
    - WHILE Loop
    - CONTINUE
 
<br>  

<br>  


##### Simple Loop 

- Encloses sequence of statements in between the LOOP and END LOOP keywords.
- The action statements can be a single or block of statements
- In each iteration, the sequence of statements within the loop is executed and then control resumes at the top of the loop
- An EXIT statement or an EXIT WHEN statement is required to break the loop and then the control passes to the next statement after the END LOOP.
- The condition can be a variable or expression which returns a boolean value.


    ###### Using EXIT  
    
    - When the EXIT statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and program control resumes at the next statement after the END LOOP.
    - For nested loops (one loop inside another loop), the EXIT statement will stop the execution of the innermost loop and start executing the next line of code after the block.

```sql
DECLARE 
   x number := 10; 
BEGIN 
   LOOP 
      dbms_output.put_line(x); 
      x := x + 10; 
      IF x > 50 THEN 
         exit; 
      END IF; 
   END LOOP; 
   -- after exit, control resumes here  
   dbms_output.put_line('After Exit x is: ' || x); 
END; 
```

```sql
DECLARE 
   x number := 10; 
BEGIN 
   LOOP 
      dbms_output.put_line(x); 
      x := x + 10; 
      exit WHEN x > 50; 
   END LOOP; 
   -- after exit, control resumes here 
   dbms_output.put_line('After Exit x is: ' || x); 
END;
```

##### FOR Loop 

##### WHILE Loop 

##### CONTINUE
